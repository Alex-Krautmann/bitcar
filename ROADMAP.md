> Here are a list of features coming soon...

   *  github driver to use node-github
   *  github enterprise support
   *  bitbucket.org support
   *  well-defined spec for driver
   *  separate packages for drivers
   *  `--create` option (create new repo)
   *  `--pull-all` option (pull on all repos)
   *  zsh completions
   *  nvm support (n support was recently added, let's throw a bone to the nvm folks)
   *  `--search` option (code search, probably will be delegated to ripgrep with fallback to grep)

## Long-Term Roadmap

   *  `--server` support (run bitcar as a server which a bitcar client can then be configured to use as cache and/or code search.
